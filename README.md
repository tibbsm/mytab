A simple, customizable tab template for new tabs in chrome using Svelte.

- Umberto Eco Writing System
  - Different project: web clipper to save articles, bibliography
- [Svelte Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs)
  - one new thing about svelte a day
    - array methods (.push, .splice) do not trigger reactivity [link](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/updating-arrays-and-objects)
    - only values within the `$:` block will trigger reactivity ($: tot = yPlusValue(x) // only x will trigger)
  - learn about event (dispatch) and stores

- Types are correct?
