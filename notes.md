At the end of the day, all I wanted was a simple page to display want I want when I open a new Chrome tab.

I've been working on something that is so small and simple for a long time and not making progress towards something that should be able to be completed in a day.

One issue, is that I didn't have a vision of what I wanted.

Every time I had an idea I just started working on it, but I never asked myself if I really needed it.

So I think from here we need to:

- think out what you need
- remember simplicity is the point
- just finish it
- if other ideas come up, write them down, but dont do them yet. Let them marinate
- move onto other fun projects
